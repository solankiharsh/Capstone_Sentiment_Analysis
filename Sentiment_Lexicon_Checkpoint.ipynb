The key idea is to use techniques from text analytics, NLP, machine learning and linguistics to extract important information or data points from unstructured text.

Neutral sentiment typically has 0 polarity since it does not express any specific sentiment, positive sentiment will have polarity > 0 and negative < 0. Of course you can always change these thresholds based on the type of text you are dealing with and there are no hard constraints on this.\n",

A lexicon model typically uses a lexicon, also known as a dictionary or vocabulary of words specifically aligned towards sentiment analysis. Usually these lexicons contain a list of words associated with positive and negative sentiment, polarity (magnitude of negative or positive score), parts of speech (POS) tags, subjectivity classifiers (strong, weak, neutral), mood, modality and so on.\n",
